<h1>Password Maker</h1>

<h3>Warrenty</h3>
   <p>I created Password Maker for my own use, therefore there is absolutely no warrenty or support associated with it.  You can use it only at your own risk.  Of course, you are welcome to contact me about it - I reserve the right to respond or not.</p>
   
<h3>Overview</h3>
   <p>Password Maker is a simple tool that will create random passwords and then encrypt the chosen password using one of the four symmetric key algorithms available in .NET.  It allows you to toggle the byte representation between decimal, hexidecimal and Base64 encoding formats.</p>
   
   <p>The private symmetric key and initialization vector will be automatically generated.</p>
   
   <p>You can also paste a password of your choice into the password field.</p>
   
   <h3>Random Passwords</h3>
   
   <p>Choose a password length and then click the Random button to generate a random password.  Under the Random menu are options to include or exclude various characters from the radomizer.  Unchecking Similar Characters will remove characters like upper case O and lower case l from the set of characters to chose from.</p>
   
   <h3>Encrypting</h3>
   
   <p>Click the Encrypt button to have the string in the password field encrypted using a symmetic key and init vector.  The key and init vector will be chosen randomly each time you click Encrypt.</p>
   
   <p>The default symmetric key algorithm is AES/Rijndael using the largest key size.  You can change the algorithm and key size under the appropriate menus.</p>
   
   <h3>Copying</h3>
   
   <p>Finally, you can copy the encrypted version of the password, the private key and the init vector to use elsewhere.  The Delimiter menu toggles what separates each byte value in the decimal and hexidecimal format.</p>
